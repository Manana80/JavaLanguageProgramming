Loops	   Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
	        Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

While Loop	The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
	        while (condition) {
	          // code block to be executed
        	}

	In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:
	int i = 0;
	while (i < 5) {
	  System.out.println(i);
	  i++;
	}
	  Note: Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!

The Do/While Loop:	 The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop.
This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true,
then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
	 do {
	  // code block to be executed
	 }
	 while (condition);

	The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once,
	even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:
	int i = 0;
	do {
	  System.out.println(i);
	  i++;
	}
	while (i < 5);
	Note: Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!


For Loop:	When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code,
 use the for loop instead of a while loop:
	for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
	  // code block to be executed
	}
	Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
	Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
	Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

	The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	  System.out.println(i);
	}
	Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (int i = 0).
	Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, the loop will end.
	Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

	This example will only print even values between 0 and 10:
	for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {
	  System.out.println(i);
	}

For-Each Loop	There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array:
	for (type variableName : arrayName) {
	  // code block to be executed
	}

	The following example outputs all elements in the cars rray, using a "for-each" loop:
	String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
	for (String i : cars) {
	  System.out.println(i);
	}
